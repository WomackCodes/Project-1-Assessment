### _Getting started:_

#### OVERALL APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
As you saw, the application's UI consists of:

A count display
Two buttons ("+" & "-")
An <input> element
Use the screenshots below as your "wireframes".

Lastly, the styling does not have to be exact, however, the closer it is to the screenshots, the better!

#### PROCESS
This assessment is an individual assignment - no collaboration please.

The good news is that it's "open book" - you may reference anything on your computer, Google, use notes, etc.

However, don't spend too much time researching unless you're stuck - do not over-think this application!!!

It is estimated that this project assessment will take 30 to 60 minutes to complete. However, you have up to 3 hours to complete this assessment.
